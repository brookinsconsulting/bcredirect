Usage
=====

I needed to accomplish this too, but didn't succeed by using existing functionality.

I made my own module which redirects to the main node of an object, by specifying the object id as a parameter in the URL. I've uploaded my extension to pubsvn, you can check it out from http://pubsvn.ez.no/community/trunk/extension/redirect.

Installation and use:

- enable the extension
- give your users access to the redirect module (assign them a role with a policy for function redirect of module redirect)
- you can use /redirect/mainnode/<i>yourobjectid</i> in the RedirectURIAfterPublish hidden input field.
- custom view parameters are passed by in the URL, so you can use /redirect/mainnode/<i>yourobjectid</i>/(customkey)/customvalue.

The extension was created in April 2005, and hasn't been tested on more recent releases of eZ publish. Feel free to try it, I hope it solves your problem.
